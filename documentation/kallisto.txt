# tutorial for Kallisto
# created by Alejandro Schmieder

# this is a tutorial for performing Kallisto, which is a pseudoalignment tool
# the commands for performing the various (and required) Kallisto commands are as follows:

# Kallisto index:

$ kallisto index -i transcripts.idx transcripts.fasta.gz

# kallisto index builds a kallisto/transcriptome index; this output is specified/named by the "transcripts.idx" file.
# the "transcripts.fasta.gz" file is the cDNA file, which is found @ /data/scratch/ensembl-92/danio_rerio/cDNA/

# Kallist quant:
# kallisto quant runs the quantification algorithm and generates the abundances for each of the individual transcripts

$ kallisto quant -i transcripts.idx -o output -b 100 readsR1.fastq readsR2.fastq 
# this kallisto command is for paired-end; the "-i transcripts.idx" calls the transcriptome index previously constructed; the "-o output" specifies the output directory; not sure what "-b 100" is
# "readsR1.fastq readsR2.fastq" are the two paired datasets
$ kallisto quant -i transcripts.idx -o output -b 100 --single -l 190 -s 20 reads.fastq
# this kallisto command is for single-end data, which is specified by the "--single".
# With single-end data, the length & standard deviation of the fragments most be specified: "-l 190" is the length, where 190 is the average length of Illumina fragments, while "-s 20" is the standard deviation, where 20 is the average standard deviation.
# obviously, you're only using 1 input file because it's single-end, so there's one data

# Kallisto pseudo:
# kallisto pseudo runs the pseudoalignment tool

$ kallisto pseudo -i transcripts.idx -o output <FASTQ files>
# the above is for paired-end data; this basically has the same information as kallisto quant and kallisto index
$ kallisto pseudo -i transcripts.idx -o output --single -l 190 -s 20 <FASTQ files>
# the above is for single-end data, which, again, basically has the same information as the kallisto quant and kallisto index commands/steps

# tutorial for htseq-count
# created by Alejandro Schmieder

# this tutorial is for htseq-count
# the following command is performed to complete htseq-count:

$ htseq-count -f bam -s no <bam_file> <gtf_file>

# the "htseq-count" calls the command
# -f is the filetype; we want the filetype to be BAM (the default is SAM, but the ouput of HISAT2 is BAM)
# -s is whether the output should be stranded; we don't want the output to be stranded, so we type "no"
# the input is a BAM file, hence <bam_file>
# the gene annotations files is a GTF file, hence <gtf_file>
